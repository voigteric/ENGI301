INSTRUMENT GLOVE
by ERIC VOIGT

Project for PocketBeagle which uses Python to play instrument audio files when a user bends their fingers.
Please visit https://www.hackster.io/eric-voigt/instrument-glove-4537b7 for a complete tutorial and build instructions.

IMPLEMENTATION FILES:
instrument_glove.py -- the main program which runs the instrument glove
run.sh -- startup script which runs instrument_glove.py on reboot

To autoboot run.sh, install these files and then add line to crontab:
@reboot sleep 30 && sh /var/lib/cloud9/project_01/run.sh > /var/lib/cloud9/project_01/logs/cronlog 2>&1

The project_01 folder also contains audio files which are called by the glove to play through headphones.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:
1. Clone this repository in /var/lib/cloud9/ for the PocketBeagle
2. Assemble glove and connections to PocketBeagle
3. Run instrument_glove.py on PocketBeagle and play glove, making adjustments to play_sounds() within instrument_glove.py to tune bend thresholds and audio file destinations
4. Make some music!
